# Work Experience

## IT Specialist and Software Engineer @ Digital Anatomy Simulations for Healthcare

I fulfilled diverse roles as an IT Specialist, Systems Administrator, and Programmer, 
blending technical expertise with problem-solving to drive innovation and efficiency. 
As an IT Specialist, I managed device provisioning, configured user accounts, resolved 
technical support tickets, and set up secure office network infrastructure, ensuring 
seamless operations and robust connectivity. My role as a Systems Administrator 
involved administering AWS and Ubuntu cloud environments, automating backups, managing 
DNS and permissions, and implementing security measures to maintain resource integrity 
and availability. As a Programmer, I developed web applications, VR/AR training 
prototypes, and 3D printing automation tools using technologies like Python, ReactJS, 
Unreal Engine, and Java. These tools enhanced user experiences, optimized workflows, 
and supported critical medical applications, demonstrating my ability to bridge 
infrastructure management and software development.

## Freelance work

I designed and deployed virtualization servers, Docker environments, and NAS devices, 
ensuring secure and efficient systems for testing, staging, and data management. I 
managed Unix/Linux servers on platforms like AWS and Contabo, implementing robust 
backup solutions, firewall configurations, and software deployments to maintain high 
availability. Additionally, I developed an open-source link-shortening application and 
streamlined development workflows with CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions. My client-
focused work includes creating customized WordPress websites and optimizing SQL 
configurations to meet business needs, demonstrating a blend of innovation and 
adaptability across varied technical landscapes.

## Project Leader, Gameplay Software Engineer @ "John's Wizard Dungeon" Game Dev Team

I successfully led a multidisciplinary team in the development and release of an 
innovative VR game on Steam, managing project workflows, coordinating tasks, and 
ensuring milestones were met. By spearheading the game's design and implementation 
using C++ and Unreal Engine Blueprints, I created a seamless and immersive user 
experience with high-quality mechanics, graphics, and interactivity. Additionally, I 
managed the game's integration with Steam, ensuring compliance with platform 
requirements and optimizing its presence on the store, culminating in the successful 
and timely launch of a compelling VR experience.
