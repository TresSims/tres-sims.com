Iâ€™m Tres Sims, a highly motivated and experienced technical artist, looking for my next
big adventure! I have experience creating python tools and standalone software to bring
the DCC of the simulation industry to 3D printing, and am looking to bring my experience
to the gaming and simulation industry.
