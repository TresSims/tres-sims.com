A few years ago I made a [demo]({{< ref "ARBoardGameDemo.md" >}}) to showcase how AR 
could potentially be used to bring another level of functionality to tabletop gaming.  
This shader is a revisiting of some of the work I did for that project, or rather, this 
project is me creating a tool I *should* have made for that project, but didn't consider.

In the original piece, the way I created the 'distressed wallpaper' look ended up 
looking more like paint on damaged drywall. It wasn't the worst, but for what I imagined 
was an older victorian era mansion, I think this gives a more realistic appearance. 

I designed the shader to look like sheets of wallpaper were peeling up from the edges, 
revealing the hardwood behing them. I also exposed parameters, such as wallaper texture 
and tiling, as well as wear so that you can re-use the material on multiple different 
locations.
