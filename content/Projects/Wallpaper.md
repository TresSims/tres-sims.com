This is a material I made in substance designer that is designed to look like faded wallpaper. 
The shader was created using Substance Designer, then imported into Unreal Engine 5 for the 
beauty shots. 

I designed the shader to look like sheets of wallpaper were peeling up from the edges, revealing 
the hardwood behing them. I also exposed parameters, such as wallaper texture and tiling, as well 
as wear so that you can re-use the material on multiple different locations.
